# CIS-171-Java-FinalProject
CIS-171 Final Project demonstrates the use of a laptop purchasing site that builds off the midterm project and adds a functional GUI to the program
* Program was creating using Java
* Program was built in Eclipse IDE
* Program works essentially as the first version of the laptop purchasing program, but with a new functional GUI that 
  utilizes the Java MVC along with the JFrame and JPanel libraries
* Please feel free to contact me regarding any issues opening or running the program and/or any changes you would want to see made to improve the program :)
